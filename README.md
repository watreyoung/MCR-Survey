# Survey of Modern Code Review (MCR) 
In this repository, we collected papers related to modern code review (MCR) from Jan. 2013 to Feb. 2024. We propose a taxonomy of MCR tasks, aiming to assist developers and researchers to gain a better understanding of MCR. More detailed information can be found in our paper "Understanding and Enhancing Modern Code Review: Progresses, Challenges and Opportunities".
