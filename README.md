# MCR-Survey
Collecting related papers of modern code review (MCR) from Jan. 2013 to Feb. 2024. We propose a taxonomy of MCR tasks, aiming to assist developers and researchers to gain a better understanding of MCR. More detailed information can be seen in our paper "Understanding and Enhancing Modern Code Review: Progresses, Challenges and Opportunities".
